## User Submitted

These are shaders submitted by users. Please only upload shaders you've written yourself
or where you can be certain the license is explicitly permissive. This is a sharing site
and OSL files will be flying left and right.

If not there, add to the header of your file that it is under the MIT license by adding 
this line or something equivalent:

    // License: MIT License, https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/3dsMax-OSL-Shaders/blob/master/LICENSE.txt

Each user builds their own subdirectory under this to place their shaders. Some may later
be promoted to other folders.
